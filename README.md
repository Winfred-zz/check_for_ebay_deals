# check_for_ebay_deals
Python script that checks ebay search queries for low prices and then notifies on Discord.

It's relatively basic, but it works.

The following modules are required:

* httpx[http2] parsel nested_lookup
* requests
* beautifulsoup4
* discord.py
* colorlog

Check the configs directory for a list of files that need to be configured.
